# Development Workflow

This guide outlines the development workflow for the Random Beep extension.

## Implementation Phases

The implementation follows a three-phase approach:

1. **Phase 1: Core Functionality**
   - Set up project structure
   - Implement background script with timer logic
   - Develop random break algorithm
   - Build notification system
   - Create basic UI for popup
   - Implement storage mechanisms

2. **Phase 2: Enhanced Features**
   - Complete settings page
   - Implement theme support
   - Add statistics tracking
   - Develop statistics visualization
   - Create exportable session data

3. **Phase 3: Polishing**
   - Refine UI/UX
   - Add animations and transitions
   - Implement sound effects
   - Add keyboard shortcuts
   - Optimize performance

## Testing Approach

- Unit tests for timer logic and random algorithm
- Integration tests for storage and UI interaction
- End-to-end testing of complete user flows
- Browser compatibility testing (Chrome initially)

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:
1. Social sharing features
2. Cloud sync across browsers
3. Additional themes and customization
4. Productivity insights and recommendations
5. Extension to other browsers (Firefox, Edge, etc.)
